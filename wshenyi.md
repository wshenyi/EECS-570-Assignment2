# PA2 Waypoint

## Current Progress

Since I am not good at writing code, it took me a long time to learn the syntax and semanctics of *Murphi* language. During this process, I also learnt a little bit about predicate logic, without this background I really don't know what the invirants represent.

Currently, I am still working on implementing MSI baseline and I get stuck in modifying the MSI directory protocol provided by book, *coherence primer*. In order to adapt to the out-of-order network, I add extra invirants and extra transition states to the homenode and the processor. However, it turns out combining extra transistion states with extra invirants is non-trivial to achieve.

## Prospective Optimization

I plan to finish a MOESI protocol for 1 memory location with arbitrary values in the future. And I also plan to achieve migratory sharing optimization to my cache coherence protocol.
