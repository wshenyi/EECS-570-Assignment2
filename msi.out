Murphi Release 3.1
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

==========================================================================

Protocol: msi

Algorithm:
	Verification by breadth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 2728 bits (rounded up to 344 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  134 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 385249 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for breadth-first search: 38524 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.

Status:

	No error found.

State Space Explored:

	22199 states, 89229 rules fired in 0.91s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
	The maximum size for the multiset "DirNode.sharers" is: 3.
	The maximum size for the multiset "Net[Directory]" is: 5.
	The maximum size for the multiset "Net[Proc_1]" is: 3.
	The maximum size for the multiset "Net[Proc_2]" is: 4.
	The maximum size for the multiset "Net[Proc_3]" is: 4.
